# Reaching Out
```
Hi Sonya,
I’m a fellow ABC University alum and came across your profile. I graduated in 2003, 
also with a degree in History, and have been working in the PR industry for the past 
few years. I’m currently job hunting and hoping to make the transition from the 
agency side into a role at a nonprofit or university. I really admire your career and 
was wondering if you might be willing to offer some advice or perhaps chat by phone? 
I would really appreciate your time and would be happy to do anything I can to help you

You never want to sound desperate and you never want to ask directly for a job or to send a resume. The goal here, as with any good networking message, is to establish rapport and ask for general information and advice.
